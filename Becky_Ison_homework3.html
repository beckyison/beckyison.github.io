    <h2>Page Title</h2>
    <p> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        The page < title > is found within the < head > tag on all of the pages checked and it does accurately and briefly describe the content of the page.
        The page titles were all unique and create ability to identify the site accurately. 
    One thing that I noticed was that on many of the pages there was a redundant element in the title in which after the page title was mentioned was: "Lake County Public Library at Lake County Public Library". </p>

    <h2>Image Text Alternatives</h2>
    <p> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        On the home page, there was no alt text provided for the author photo or for the fundraising thermometer. 
        Also, the fundraising sponser images did not include alt text. 
        On the Catalog page, all of the tool photos presented did had alt text which accurately described the photo contents.
        We recommend that all images and graphic content have alt text descriptions so that people using screen readers will have access to information being provided visually.
    </p>

    <h2>Text</h2>
    <p>Headings: <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        I tested the Home, Colorado Mountain History, and Mission and Values pages. 
        The pages had two h1 headers per page. 
        The first headers on all of the pages were not visible on the site and contained the text: "Original text."
        This could be an issue for those navigating the page with a screen reader. 
        The h1 and and h2 tags did appear to be nested correctly beyond the additional h1 tags.
    </p>

    <p>Contrast Ratio:  
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i>
        The contrast ratio was tested using the WAVE accessibility evaluation tool. 
        I observed black text on a white background, which had a high contrast. 
        There was also white text on a dark green background, which had a contrast rating of 7.42:1. 
        The dark green text on the white background had a contrast rating of 7.23:1. 
        Additionally, the white text on a light green background was found to have a low contrast level of 2.13:1, which could be problematic to those with low vision.
        I recommend using colors with a higher contrast level where the light green background and white text are in place.
    </p>

    <p>Resizing Text: <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> The reflow, or resizing text, worked well on the website. I enlarged the screen magnification to 200% and was still able to access all of the information. Everything remained readable and comprehensible. </p>
    
    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>Keyboard Access and Visual Focus: 
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        Trying to navigate the homepage using just the keyboard worked well for the most part. 
        The visual focus was clear on some parts of the site, but less clear on other parts. 
        On the dark green navigation bar, it was difficult to see the thin, black outline on the selected features. 
        Also, on the light green navigation buttons on the left side of the page, the selections were not very clear. I was able to see only a thin dashed outline around the boxes.
        The blue outline along with the underlined text, as seen on the white boxes in the left navigation menu, were much more helpful.
        I recommend making that outline on the green boxes thicker, and possibly using a higher color contrast there.
        I was able to use the enter key to select and navigate to links.
    </p>

    <p>Forms, Labels, and Errors: 
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i> 
        On the homepage, the search field "Find books" was not labeled on the top or left, which would make it more easily accessible. 
        It did, however, have a button underneath the field. 
        It also included a < form > tag as well as a < title > with a very detailed desccription of what the field is to be used for.
        On the Mission & Values page, the "Sign up for our newsletter!" form was easily accessbile using only the keyboard.
        I was able to enter text into the email address field, select a checkbox, and submit.
    </p>
            
    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>Moving, Flashing, or Blinking Content:
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>
     On the Colorado Mountain History Collection, there is an image carousel which is accessible through the arrow buttons on the keyboard. 
        The images move very slowly, and stop moving on their own when cycled through using the keyboard.
        I did not find any flashing or blinking content. </p>

    <p>Multimedia (video, audio) Alternatives: 
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i>
        On the Video Tutorials site, the videos did not start automatically.
        Additionally, I was able to control the videos using only the keyboard.
        I was able to access the closed captions (cc) feature using only the keyboard. 
        The closed captions provided were automatic and were not completely accurate.
        I recommend providing accurate captions as well as a transcript to make these videos accessible to those with hearing impairments.
    </p>

    <p>Basic Structure Check:
        <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        I used the WAVE accessibility evaluation tool to remove all CSS styling. 
        On the homepage, the alt text shows up with low contrast grey text on a white background and the text, "Original text" does not convey any useful meaning to the user.
        When linearized, the navigation is displayed at the top, before the main content.
        The pages seem to be easy to navigate without styling, except for those first h1 headings, which seem unnecessary.
    </p>
