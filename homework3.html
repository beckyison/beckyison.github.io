    <h2>Page Title</h2>
    <p> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        The page < title > is found within the < head > tag on all of the pages checked and it does accurately and briefly describe the content of the page.
        The page titles were all unique and create ability to identify the site accurately. 
    One thing that I noticed was that on many of the pages there was a redundant element in the title in which after the page title was mentioned was: "Lake County Public Library at Lake County Public Library". </p>

    <h2>Image Text Alternatives</h2>
    <p> <i class="fa fa-thumbs-up"></i>  <i class="fa fa-thumbs-down"></i> 
        On the home page, there was no alt text provided for the author photo or for the fundraising thermometer. 
        Also, the fundraising sponser images did not include alt text. 
        On the Catalog page, all of the tool photos presented did had alt text which accurately described the photo contents.
        We recommend that all images and graphic content have alt text descriptions so that people using screen readers will have access to information being provided visually.
